### Project Desciption
For this assignment we need to create logging code to make it to enable the use a configuration file for logging that results in the following behavior:

--> A program should allow us to print log messages to show the request information as well as creating another file that can print whatever we want but only when the debug level log function is triggered.\
--> We need to write a test to check that the debug file is created and another test checks that the request log file is created.\
--> We need to submit a link to the project on Github and have badges that show that our code passes the tests and links to the project hosted on heroku.
